      <h2>Summer Project - The Curve Shortening Flow (2025)</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Supervisor:</strong> Prof. Raphael Zentner (Durham University)<br>
        <strong>Topic:</strong> Curve-shortening flow as a geometric evolution equation.<br>
        Studied the curve shortening flow as a model geometric evolution equation, analysing how parabolic PDE methods - particularly the maximum and comparison principles govern the flow’s geometric behaviour. 
Explored proofs of the avoidance and convexity theorems, the role of infinite propagation and smoothing, and connections to Grayson’s theorem, linking analysis and geometry in the study of evolving curves.

      <h2>Applications of Analytic Continuation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Co-authored with:</strong> Tom Macauley<br>
        Investigated analytic continuation as a unifying framework across complex analysis, topology, and theoretical physics. 
The paper examined holomorphic extensions, the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function, and Wick rotations, 
highlighting the role of Riemann surfaces and the Monodromy Theorem in relating analytic and geometric structures.

      <h2>Mentorship — LIMS</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Mentor:</strong> Prof. Yang-Hui He (London Institute for Mathematical Sciences)<br>
        Invited to the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences by Professor Yang-Hui He, participating regularly in seminars, colloquia, and the LONTI series. 
Collaborated with researchers and discussed current topics at the interface of geometry, topology, and mathematical physics, as well as emerging links between geometry, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. 
Gained first-hand experience of a mathematical research environment and was mentored by Professor He, whose seminar series - A Playful Introduction to Some Modern Geometry profoundly influenced my understanding of modern geometry.
