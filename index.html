    <h2>About</h2>
<p>
I am an undergraduate mathematician at Durham University specialising in pure mathematics, with broad interests in geometry, topology, and algebra. 
My recent work includes a summer project on the curve-shortening flow supervised by Professor Raphael Zentner and an ongoing dissertation on the Poincaré Conjecture under the supervision of Professor Andrew Lobb. 
I have also been mentored by Professor Yang-Hui He at the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences, where I have participated in seminars on algebraic geometry and modern geometry. 
My current research interests centre on geometric and topological structures, and I intend to pursue postgraduate study in pure mathematics focusing on algebraic topology and related areas.
